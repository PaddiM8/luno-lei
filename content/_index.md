## About

Luno Lei is a constructed language with a tiny dictionary
where grammar is used to give words a wide range of
meanings. For example, the words for "small", "huge", "size",
"measure", "reduce", etc. can be derived from the same root
word using simple grammatical rules.

In cases where word building is not enough, words are combined,
sometimes in poetic ways. There is no word for "sun", but it
could, for example, be expressed by saying "the light that nature holds"
(valosva luono lavopi) or simply "nature light" (luonovalosva)
depending on context.
