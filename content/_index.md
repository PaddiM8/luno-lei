## About

Luno Lei is a constructed language with a tiny dictionary
where grammar is used to give words a wide range of
meanings.

For example, the words for `small`, `huge`, `size`,
`measure`, `reduce`, etc. can be derived from the same root
word using simple grammatical rules.

### What it is
* The entire language could fit on a poster
* Optimised for getting by with a small vocabulary
* Has a rich and flexible grammar 
* A fun way to play around with language and finding
  creative ways of expressing oneself

### What it is not
* Not as simple as Toki Pona - being as easy as possible to learn is not a goal
* Often does not result in compact sentences
* Not meant to allow for particularly precise communication, similar to Toki Pona

## Examples
