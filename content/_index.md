## About

Luno Lei is a constructed language with a tiny dictionary
where grammar is used to give words a wide range of
meanings. For example, the words for "small", "huge", "size",
"measure", "reduce", etc. can be derived from the same root
word using simple grammatical rules.

In cases where word building is not enough, words are combined,
sometimes in poetic ways. There is no word for "sun", but it
could, for example, be expressed by saying "the light that nature holds"
(valosva luono lavopi) or simply "nature light" (luonovalosva)
depending on context.

### What it is
* The entire language could fit on a poster
* Optimised for getting by with a small vocabulary
* Has a rich and flexible grammar 

### What it is not
* Not as simple as Toki Pona
* Often does not result in compact sentences
* Not meant to allow for particularly precise communication, similar to Toki Pona
