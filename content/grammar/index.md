## Verb conjugation

With verb conjugation, a word the verb form of
a word is used. For example, "noka" (foot) as a verb
results in "to foot"/"to walk".

Relative person can be translated to *who*, *whom*,
*whose*, *which*, *that*, etc. in English.

### Singular
| Tense/Person | 1st   | 2nd   | 3rd   | Relative |
| ------------ | ----- | ----- | ----- | -------- |
| Past         | -nu   | -su   | -pu   | -mu      |
| Present      | -n(i) | -s(i) | -pi   | -mi      |
| Future       | -naso | -saso | -paso | -maso    |

#### Example
nokan - I walk  
nokas - You walk  
nokanu - I walked

### Plural

Plural is added to a conjugation in order to express
a plurality in the person. This would turn "I" into
"we", or 3rd person singular into "they".

<span class="particle">su</span>

#### Example
su oninaso - we will act

## Noun & Descriptor conjugation

Noun and descriptor conjugation is used when a word
should not be verbified. Instead, it expresses *state*.
For example, "ikeve" (small) conjugated in this way
results in "to be small". With verb conjugation, it
would instead refer to "to decrease".

### Singular
| Tense/Person | 1st   | 2nd   | 3rd   | Relative |
| ------------ | ----- | ----- | ----- | -------- |
| Past         | -noa  | -soa  | -poa  | -moa     |
| Present      | -neo  | -seo  | -peo  | -meo     |
| Future       | -nowi | -sowi | -powi | -mowi    |

#### Example
ikesan - I am big
ikesas - You are big
ikesanu - I were big

### Plural

Plural is added to a conjugation in order to express
a plurality in the person. This would turn "I" into
"we", or 3rd person singular into "they".

<span class="particle">lu</span>

## Number

Plural in this form is used to express plurality
for words themself. For example, "object" (oni)
into "objects" (oniye). When applied to verbs,
it refers to something being done several times.

| Kind | Plural |
| ---- | ------ |
| Noun | -ye    |
| Verb | -yoa   |

#### Example
lavoye - hands  
lavoyoa - to hold several times

## Comparison

Comparative and superlative are added to descriptors.

| Comparative | Superlative |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| -vo         | -vie        |

#### Example
ikesavo - bigger  
ikesavie - biggest

## Possession

There are different ways to express possession.
However, normally, possession is expressed
with the word "lave" combined with the inessive
case.

#### Example

lavolien kotusas - I have a home  
kotusa lavolien - My home (note the lack of accusative)

## Questions

<span class="particle">esa</span>

The `esa` article is used for questions. It can be placed
anywhere in a sentence, but is generally placed at the start
or end of a sentence.

## Cases

Unlike in some languages, accusative does not indicate
movement towards the direct object. Instead, lative is
used to express movement. Partitive is similar to
accusative but also expresses that something is
incomplete, for example a book only being partly read.
Semblative expressses some form of similarity between
objects or concepts.

| Case            | Suffix | Uses                      |
| --------------- | ------ | ------------------------- |
| Nominative      | -      | -                         |
| Accusative      | -s     | direct object             |
| Lative          | -su    | motion towards            |
| Ablative        | -sol   | motion from               |
| Prolative       | -sat   | via, through, along       |
| Partitive       | -sia   | direct object, incomplete |
| Dative          | -da    | indirect object           |
| Locative/Essive | -li    | at (location, time)       |
| Semblative      | -kus   | similarity                |

#### Example
lavon vileas - I have a plant  
nokan enisisu - I walk to you  
nokan enisisol - I walk from you  
nokas vuolavesat - You walk through the hole  
liposasian - I read part of a book  
munin enisida - I talk to you  
kotusalin - I am at home  
valovepeo measavikovekus - It is dark like at night

### Stacking cases

Stacking cases are added after regular cases. For example,
the `In-` case could be combined with locative to create
inessive, `-lie`.

| Case     | Suffix | Uses                |
| -------- | ------ | ------------------- |
| In-      | -e     | in, inside          |
| Super-   | -u     | over, above, on     |
| Sub-     | -os    | under               |
| Behind   | -st    | behind              |
| In front | -se    | in front            |
| Adjacent | -at    | adjacent, nearby    |
| Inter-   | -wo    | between, in-between |

#### Example
kotulien - I am inside a house  

## Nil word

The nil word (`eni`) can be used to extract the pure meaning
of grammatical features. For example, in order to say just "in",
one could say "enilie".

### Pronouns

Pronouns are created by applying a conjugation suffix to the
nil word.

#### Example
enins - me  
enipi enisikus - It is similar to you

## Voices

### Passive

<span class="suffix">-slu</span>

The passive voice is used as a "zero person". It can also be used
to verbify a word without specifying a person (eg. leg -> to walk).

#### Example
kiaslu - One reads  
pitan nokaslu - I like to walk

## Moods
