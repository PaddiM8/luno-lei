## Gradiency

Gradiency is a way to change the meaning of a word.
Words in the dictionary are written in neutral form.
This often does not have an English translation and
is somehwere in-between the "less" form and the "more"
form. The "more" form could for example imply a larger
size, more activity, more effort, more notable, more
beneficial to the subject, and so on, depending on
context.

| Kind       | Less | Neutral | More |
| ---------- | ---- | ------- | ---- |
| Noun       | -sve | -       | -sva |
| Descriptor | -ve  | -       | -sa  |

#### Example
suto - neither sweet nor sour  
sutove - sour  
sutosa - sweet  
lavo - hand  
lavosve - finger  
lavosva - arm

## Intensifiers & Diminutives

Intensifiers and diminutives are used to express
either more or less intensity regarding a word. 
Unlike gradiency, this does not change the core
meaning of a word. However, in some cases, the
difference between, for example, the "more" form
and the "intensifier" form of a word may be similar.

Often, intensifiers and diminutives are stacked
on top of gradiency suffixes as a way to be more
specific. For example, applying both the "more"
form and the diminutive form to "varma" (lukewarm)
results in "slightly warm". In this example,
gradiency is used to express warmth, while the
diminutive form tones it down.

| Kind       | Diminutive | Intensifier |
| ---------- | ---------- | ----------- |
| Noun       | -tie       | -tuo        |
| Verb       | -tue       | -teo        |
| Descriptor | -toe       | -tao        |

#### Example
varmasatoe - slightly warm
nokan - I walk (without diminutive and gradiency)
nokasva - leg (without diminutive)
nokateon - I run (with diminutive but without gradiency)
lavovetie - a small finger/pinky  

## Objectification

<span class="suffix">-lo</span>

When a word have both descriptor and noun
meanings, the descriptor meaning is the default
one. In order to turn it into a noun, the
objectification suffix has to be added.
Objectification is implied when
the noun form of a gradiency suffix is
used.

#### Example
ikeve - small
ikelo - a small thing

## Abstractification

<span class="prefix">go(t)-</span>

A noun can be made more abstract or generalised by
applying the abstractification prefix.

#### Example
lawa - head  
golawa - mind  
varma - lukewarm  
govarma - temperature

## Colours

Colours are expressed using three words:

* dio - red
* via - green
* blu - blue

These can be combined to express different
colours. For example, combining blue and
green results in yellow, meaning yellow is
expressed as "bluvia".

Additionally, the words for "dark" and "light"
can be used to specify brightness.

#### Example
viadio - purple  
valosavia - light green

## Counting

Numbers are expressed in a form of scientific
notation, such as "1.23*10^3". The "dek" particle
is used to express the "*10^" part and the dot is
implied.
